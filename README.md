Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
**This app was designed to track a user's weight loss and weight goals.  The user could enter their daily weight.  All of their daily weight is saved in a database and displays all the entered days to the user.  The user could enter what their goal weight is.  When the user reached their goal the app would send an SMS saying congratulations.**

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
**My app required a login screen and register account.  It also required a main screen where the user could enter their daily weight and goal weight.  Both the daily weight and goal weight had separate screens as well.  I also implemented a request for SMS Notification popup for the user.  As for UI, I kept each screens color scheme the same as to not overwhelm the user.**

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
**When coding my app I created pseudocode of exactly what my application needed to do.  I then worked on one screen at a time to ensure that it worked.  These strategies can be applied in the future by always planning very well.  Also, working on small parts of a project before integrating them together is a very important skill with coding.**

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
**I was constantly debugging my project.  Also, when I tested my app on my phone I would watch the logcat constantly.  Whenever my app would crash or do something unexpected, I would look at the logcat and try to solve the issue.  This is important because an app should do everything that is expected for it to do.**

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
**My biggest issue was getting my databases to work.  I am not very familiar with building databases and utilizing CRUD in the way I did.  To overcome this I review my classes resources, as well as researched online.**

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
**I think I was successful in many parts of my app.  However, I think my login screen was the most successful.  I made it so a new user could register an account and the system would save it to a database.  Then when the user attempted to login, the system would search for the login information from the database and either login or print a statement saying user is not registered.**
